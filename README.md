### Owners

Features included for restaurant owners are menu customization, 
theme customization, customer order handling and QR code generation for tables.

### Customers

Customers can scan QR codes through the web application, order food items to their table and pay for them, as well as check their order history if an account is created.
Users can still use the service without creating an account.
