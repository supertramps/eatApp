# EatApp

## The web app

EatApp is a restuarant in house food delivery platform that is designed with scalability in mind. 
The web application targets two user demographics. Restaurant owners, and restaurant customers. 

### Owners

Features included for restaurant owners are menu customization, 
theme customization, customer order handling and qr code generation for tables.

### Customers

Customers can scan QR codes through the web application, order food items to their table and pay for them, as well as check their order history if an account is created.
Users can still use the service without creating an account.
